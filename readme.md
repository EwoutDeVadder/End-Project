# About
This project is an addon for OCPP in Home Assistant.
It will be used to automatically charge multiple cars
and change how much amperage each car should have so
some charge faster then others but the ones charging
fastest will be the cars whoms batteries are the most
empty. This is a project of a last-year middleschooler
and the project is being managed by my teacher, Mr. Buys.
